= PKI Resources

This directory contains private key files and certificates used by the
tests:

ca.crt:: The certificate of the CA that is used to sign all the other
certificates.

ca.jks:: A JKS keystore file containing the CA certificate.

localhost.key:: The private key of the `localhost` certificate.

localhost.crt:: The certificate for `localhost`.

localhost.jks:: A key store in JKS format containing the private key and
the certificate for `localhost`.

localhost.p12:: A key store in PKCS12 format containing the private key and
the certificate for `localhost`.

ugly.key:: The private key of the `ugly` certificate.

ugly.crt:: The certificate for `ugly`.

ugly.jks:: A key store in JKS format containing the private key and
the certificate for `ugly`.

ugly.p12:: A key store in PKCS12 format containing the private key and
the certificate for `ugly`.

The `ugly` private key and certificate are intended for tests that
check that connections to servers whose host name doesn't match the
certifcate common name fail.

All these certificates expire in 100 years, hopefully they will live
longer than the SDK.

The passwords of the JKS and PKCS12 key stores are `mypass`.
