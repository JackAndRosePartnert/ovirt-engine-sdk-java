= oVirt Engine API Java SDK

== Introduction

This project contains the Java SDK for the oVirt Engine API.

== Important

Note that most of the code of this SDK is automatically generated. If you
just installed the gem then you will have everything already, but if you
downloaded the source then you will need to generate it, follow the
instructions in the `README.adoc` file of the parent directory.

== Usage

To use the SDK import the `org.ovirt.engine.sdk` package. That will give you
`Connection` class. This is the entry point of the SDK, access to all the
classes of th SDK, and in particular to the and gives you access to the
root of the tree of services of the API:

[source,java]
----
import static org.ovirt.engine.sdk.Builders.connection;

// Create a connection to the server:
Connection connection = connection()
  .url("https://engine.example.com/ovirt-engine/api')
  .user("admin@internal")
  .password("...")
  .caFile("ca.pem")
  .build();

// Get the reference to the system service:
SystemService systemService = connection.systemService();

// Always remember to close the connection when finished:
connection.close();
----

The `ca.pem` file is required when connecting to a server protected
with TLS. In an usual oVirt installation it will be in
`/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem`.

Once you have the reference to the system service you can use it to get
references to other services, and call their methods. For example, to
retrieve the list of virtual machines of the system you can use the
`vmsService()` method, which returns a reference to the service that
manages the virtual machines:

[source,java]
----
// Get the reference to the "vms" service:
VmsService vmsService = systemService.vmsService()
----

This service is an instance of `VmsService`, and it has a `list` method
that returns an array of virtual machines, which are instances of the
`Vm` class:

[source,java]
----
# Retrieve the virtual machines:
List<Vms> vms = vmsService.list()

# Print the names and identifiers of the virtual machines:
for (Vm vm : vms) {
    System.out.printf("%s: %s", vm.id(), vm.name());
}
----

You will find more usuage examples in the `examples` directory.
